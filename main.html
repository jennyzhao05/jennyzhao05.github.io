      <p>
        I am a Data Science and Biology major at Northeastern University with a deep interest in the intersection of
        computational methods and the life sciences. My academic journey has strengthened my passion for applying
        data-driven approaches—such as statistical modeling, machine learning, and data visualization—to uncover
        meaningful insights in biological and medical research. I am particularly fascinated by how computational
        analysis can help decode complex biological systems and accelerate the development of new therapies.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        I am currently seeking opportunities to expand my expertise in biostatistics, computational biology,
        biological wet-lab research, and translational data analysis. Through these experiences, I aim to deepen my
        understanding of how quantitative tools can bridge the gap between biological discovery and real-world
        healthcare applications. Outside the classroom, I enjoy working on independent projects that combine
        programming, data analysis, and scientific inquiry, driven by curiosity and a genuine desire to solve
        impactful problems.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        I am always eager to take on new challenges that sharpen my technical and analytical skills, broaden my
        interdisciplinary perspective, and contribute to projects at the intersection of data science and biology
        that have the potential to make meaningful contributions to science and society.

      <h2 class="title is-3">Highlighted Project</h2>
      <p>
        My recent project, <strong>Statewide University Tuition & Rating Analysis</strong>, explores the correlation
        between tuition fees and educational quality using web-scraped data from over 1,000 institutions. The analysis
        integrates Python, BeautifulSoup, and regression modeling to visualize trends in academic and economic data.
